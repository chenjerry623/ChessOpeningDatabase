# Chess Opening Database

## A Personal Project by Jerry Chen

This is a program capable of storing/loading databases of chess openings.
These databases can be used to:
- store the user's success rate with an opening 
  - win/loss/draw count
- add results from matches and update the database
- sort openings by criteria such as wins, losses, draws and matches
- save and load databases of openings



The database will also allow the user to add or edit information on openings 
and also load past databases. The database can also be filtered and browsed 
through the criteria listed above.

**Why did I choose to make this project?**

Chess is a game that I grew up playing and still keep as hobby today. It's often hard to decide
which openings to play and study, with so many available to learn. 
This database helps with this problem by helping track which openings you play the most
and find the most success with.

**User Stories**
- As a user, I want to view my win/loss/draws and total games with an opening
- As a user, I want to sort my openings in ascending/descending order of wins/losses/draws/matches
- As a user, I want to add multiple new openings to the database
- As a user, I want to add a result to an opening
