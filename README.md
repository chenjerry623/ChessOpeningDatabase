# Chess Opening Database

## A Personal Project by Jerry Chen

This is a program capable of storing/loading databases of chess openings. 
These databases will contain information on an opening's:
- the opening moves
- win/draw/loss ratio

Some openings may also contain information for:
- amount of theory required
  - how much memorization is required in order to play it effectively?
- sharpness of the opening
  - how punishing are the early moves?
  - how beginner friendly is it?
- common themes in the opening
  - does the opening lead to open or closed games?
  - does white/black tend to attack on the queen or kingside?
  - which pieces/positions are the focal points of this opening?

The database will also allow the user to add openings and load past databases.
The database can also be filtered and browsed through the criteria listed
above.

**Why did I choose to make this project?**

Chess is a game that I grew up playing and still keep as hobby today. However, I've always found it difficult to find effective ways to 
study and prepare my openings. Online chess databases often have paywalls 
hiding deeper opening lines. Even when a chess database is paid for, they merely
provide you with the common lines which are played, rather than explaining the reasonings and goals
behind the lines. Blindly memorizing an opening like this would often leave me lost whenever a game was 15 moves deep
and I ran out of memorized lines. The only alternative to this at the time was for
me to buy chess books, which would cost a good deal of money and contain 300+ pages
of meticulously analyzing every single move in an opening line. 
This opening database provides an alternative to this problem which can 
provide more information than blind memorization but not cost quite as much
time and money. By having summaries and themes of an opening readily available,
a user can quickly get a gist of an opening without having to pour dollars and hours
into books and websites. This program can be very helpful to chess players
looking to study openings and improve their games, especially newer players
looking for an opening to study.
