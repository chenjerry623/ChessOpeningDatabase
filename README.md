# Chess Opening Database

## A Personal Project by Jerry Chen

This is a program capable of storing/loading databases of chess openings.
These databases can be used to store notes on the user's:
- success rate with an opening 
  - win/loss/draw count
  - win/loss/draw ratio
- memorization 
  - how many moves deep have I memorized this opening?
  - how much memorization do I need in order to play this opening well?


The database will also allow the user to add or edit information on openings 
and also load past databases. The database can also be filtered and browsed 
through the criteria listed above.

**Why did I choose to make this project?**

Chess is a game that I grew up playing and still keep as hobby today. Studying openings
is a crucial, albeit boring, part of playing chess. With countless openings in the game,
it can be hard to keep track of which openings you find success with, as well as
how much more studying needs to be done on an opening. Because of this, I thought 
it would be useful to have an application that can be used to track preparation, tendencies
and results with an opening.

**User Stories**
- As a user, I want to find openings which I often get draws with
- As a user, I want to find an opening that does not require a lot of memorization
- As a user, I want to add a new opening line to the database
- As a user, I want to add a win to the win count of an opening
