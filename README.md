# Chess Opening Database

## A Personal Project by Jerry Chen

This is a program capable of storing/loading databases of a player's performance with chess openings.
These databases can be used to:
- store the user's success rate with an opening 
  - win/loss/draw count
- add results from matches and update the database
- sort openings by criteria such as wins, losses, draws and matches
- save and load databases of openings
