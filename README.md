# Chess Game Storage

## A Personal Project by Jerry Chen

This is a program capable of storing/loading databases of chess games.
Each entry will contain information on:
- who played black/white in a game
- the moves played in each game
- the result of each game

The user will be able to search for:
- games played by a certain player
- games won by white/black
- games played in a certain opening

The database will also allow the user to add input new chess games into the database

**Why did I choose to make this project?**

Chess is a game which I enjoy playing as a hobby. Having an application that can
be used to store and keep track of the games I've played is something that would be very helpful.

**User Stories**
- As a user, I want to find chess matches where black wins
- As a user, I want to find chess matches with the French Defense Opening
- As a user, I want to input my own chess game into the database
- As a user, I want to find chess games played by Magnus Carlsen
